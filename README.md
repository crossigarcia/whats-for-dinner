# What's For Dinner

An application that will allow the user to get ideas for meals by searching for recipes either by category or keyword.

## User Story

AS A user,
I WANT the ability to search for recipes based on the ingredients I have available or by category SO THAT I can quickly get suggestions for dinner. 

## Usage 

* When the page loads the user is presented with two search options, one by category and one by keyword. 
* When either search is triggered recipe information is displayed on the page corresponding to what the user selected, including images, ingredients, instructions (or links to instructions), and videos. 
* When the recipe details are displayed there will also be 'next' and 'previous' buttons for the user to cycle through multiple recipes.
* If the user likes a recipe they can click a button to save it so they can reload that same recipe even if they continue searching. 
* The application is mobile responsive and resizes the content based on the user's screen size.
